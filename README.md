# Pandas Data Cleaning

This repository contains a collection of Python code snippets and techniques using pandas for data cleaning. The goal is to demonstrate various methods to clean, preprocess, and transform data efficiently using pandas, particularly for datasets that need to be prepared for analysis, machine learning, or reporting.

## Features

- Handling missing data (`NaN` values) using various techniques
- Data transformation methods (e.g., changing data types, removing unwanted characters)
- String manipulation methods
- Dropping duplicates and dealing with inconsistent data
- Parsing and formatting dates
- Handling categorical and numerical data
- Removing outliers and noise from data

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, make sure you have Python installed along with the necessary dependencies. You can install them using `pip`:
